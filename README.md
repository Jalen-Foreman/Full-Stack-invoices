# Full-Stack-invoices
A serverless app that utilizes React.js for the frontend, hosting invoice data. The React.js application is then publically hosted on AWS S3. The data for the invoices comes from DynamoDB database. I use API Gateway and AWS Lambda to create a lambda function that retrieves the data from DynamoDB which then gets hosted utilizing API Gateway. I fetch the data from API Gateway and connect the data from DynamoDB to the state within the React.js application.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
